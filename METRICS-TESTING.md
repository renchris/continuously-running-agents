# PR Metrics Injection Testing

This file demonstrates the PR runtime metrics injection system.

## Purpose

Test file created by agent-99 to validate the automatic injection of runtime metrics into pull requests.

## What Gets Injected

When an agent creates a PR, the `inject-pr-metrics.sh` script automatically appends:

1. **Runtime Metrics Table**
   - Agent number and session ID
   - Status (running/completed/error)
   - Start/completion timestamps
   - Duration in human-readable format
   - Peak CPU and RAM usage
   - Exit code
   - Restart attempt count

2. **Actionable Insights**
   - Warnings for runtime >1 hour
   - Warnings for RAM usage >1500MB
   - Warnings for CPU usage >80%
   - Error notifications
   - Restart detection alerts

3. **Deliverables Summary**
   - List of PRs created
   - List of files created

## Integration

The metrics injection is triggered automatically by `agent-completion-watcher.sh` when:
- A new PR is detected in the agent's status JSON
- Metrics haven't been injected yet (idempotent check)

## Example Metrics

See the PR description below for a live example of injected metrics from agent-99.
