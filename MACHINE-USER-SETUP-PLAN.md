# Machine User Setup Plan - Complete with Decision Pending

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Phases 1-5 Complete ‚úÖ | Phase 6 Research Complete üîç | Decision Pending ü§î

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Hetzner Claude agent was authenticated as @renchris (admin on 82+ repos), creating massive security vulnerability to prompt injection and accidental damage.

**Solution**: Machine user account (@renchris-agent) with least privilege access (per-project invitation only).

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Phases 1-5 COMPLETE** - Machine user setup, testing, and verification done
- ‚úÖ **Agent secured** - renchris-agent has access to 1 repo only (continuously-running-agents)
- ‚úÖ **Security tested** - All 5 security tests passed (agent blocked from main, isolated from other repos)
- üîç **Research complete** - Branch protection bypass investigation finished
- ü§î **Decision pending** - Choose workflow solution (see Phase 6)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Close Security Gap (COMPLETED)

### What We Did:

1. ‚úÖ **Logged out GitHub CLI** on Hetzner server
   ```bash
   gh auth logout --hostname github.com
   # Result: "Logged out of github.com account renchris"
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Deleted SSH key** from @renchris GitHub account
   - Key: "Hetzner Claude Agent - 5.78.152.238"
   - Fingerprint: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINTynuMsaLaVooK4BwcB1PnVMi6nNa8KMyPsKtPXAEeI`
   - **Manually deleted by user**

3. ‚úÖ **Verified complete lockout**
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   # Result: "You are not logged into any GitHub hosts"

   ssh -T git@github.com
   # Result: "Permission denied (publickey)"
   ```

### Security Status:
```
Hetzner Server (5.78.152.238):
  GitHub CLI: ‚ùå Not authenticated
  SSH Access: ‚ùå No valid keys
  Repository Access: ‚ùå ZERO repos accessible

Attack Surface: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
```

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Create Machine User Account (COMPLETED)

### What We Did:

1. ‚úÖ **Created GitHub account** - https://github.com/renchris-agent
   - Username: `renchris-agent`
   - Email: `ren.chris+agent@outlook.com`
   - 2FA enabled with authenticator app
   - Recovery codes saved securely

### Account Details:
- **Username**: `renchris-agent`
- **Email**: `ren.chris+agent@outlook.com`
- **Purpose**: Automation bot for Claude Code agents
- **Access Level**: Collaborator (NOT admin) on select repos only
- **Profile**: https://github.com/renchris-agent

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Configure SSH and GitHub CLI (COMPLETED)

### What We Did:

1. ‚úÖ **Generated SSH key** on Hetzner server
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ren.chris+agent@outlook.com" \
     -f ~/.ssh/renchris_agent_github -N ""
   ```
   - Public key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILrtgAI9lNYUxkGJ734kCff8hE3fmojb5XM+lQz9a2Qj`

2. ‚úÖ **Added SSH key to GitHub** (renchris-agent account)
   - Title: "Hetzner Claude Agent"
   - Successfully authenticated

3. ‚úÖ **Configured SSH config**
   ```bash
   Host github.com
     HostName github.com
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/renchris_agent_github
     IdentitiesOnly yes
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Configured git identity**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "renchris-agent"
   git config --global user.email "ren.chris+agent@outlook.com"
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Authenticated GitHub CLI**
   ```bash
   gh auth login --web --git-protocol ssh
   # Logged in as renchris-agent
   ```

6. ‚úÖ **Verified authentication**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   # Result: "Hi renchris-agent! You've successfully authenticated"

   gh auth status
   # Result: "Logged in to github.com account renchris-agent"
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Access Management (COMPLETED)

### What We Did:

1. ‚úÖ **Granted access to continuously-running-agents** (from local machine as @renchris)
   ```bash
   gh api -X PUT \
     "/repos/renchris/continuously-running-agents/collaborators/renchris-agent" \
     --field permission=push
   # Result: Invitation sent to renchris-agent
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Accepted invitation** (on Hetzner server as renchris-agent)
   ```bash
   gh api -X PATCH /user/repository_invitations/296108366
   # Result: ‚úì Invitation accepted
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Logged access** in ~/agent-repo-access.txt
   ```
   2025-10-20 | continuously-running-agents | Testing machine user setup and security model
   ```

### Current Access Status:

**renchris-agent has access to**:
- ‚úÖ continuously-running-agents (collaborator, push permission)

**renchris-agent does NOT have access to**:
- ‚ùå 81+ other personal repos (not invited)
- ‚ùå Organization repos (not invited)

**Principle of Least Privilege**: ‚úÖ ENFORCED (1 repo only)

---

## üîê How to Manage Access (For Future Use)

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT invite to all repos. Only add access when needed.

### Grant Access to Specific Repo:

**From your local machine** (as @renchris):

```bash
# Example: Grant access to continuously-running-agents
gh api -X PUT \
  "/repos/renchris/continuously-running-agents/collaborators/renchris-agent" \
  --field permission=push

echo "‚úì Invitation sent"
echo "renchris-agent must accept at: https://github.com/renchris-agent"
```

### Accept Invitation:

**On Hetzner server** (as renchris-agent):

```bash
# Via web:
# Go to https://github.com/renchris-agent
# Click "Accept invitation"

# Or via CLI:
gh api user/repository_invitations
# Note the invitation ID, then:
gh api -X PATCH /user/repository_invitations/INVITATION_ID
```

### Track Access (IMPORTANT):

**On Hetzner server**, maintain access log:

```bash
# Create access log
cat >> ~/agent-repo-access.txt <<EOF
# Repos renchris-agent has access to
# Format: Date | Repo | Reason
# --------------------------------
2025-10-20 | continuously-running-agents | Documentation updates and testing
EOF

# Update when adding access
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d) | REPO_NAME | REASON" >> ~/agent-repo-access.txt

# Update when removing access
sed -i '/REPO_NAME/d' ~/agent-repo-access.txt
```

### Revoke Access:

**From your local machine** (as @renchris):

```bash
# When agent no longer needs access
gh api -X DELETE \
  "/repos/renchris/REPO_NAME/collaborators/renchris-agent"

echo "‚úì Access revoked"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 5: Verification Testing (COMPLETED)

**All security tests PASSED** ‚úÖ

### Test Results:

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: Can create branch and push
```bash
cd ~/test-security
git checkout -b test/machine-user-security-verification
echo '# Machine User Security Test' >> MACHINE-USER-TEST.md
git add MACHINE-USER-TEST.md
git commit -m 'test: verify machine user can create branches'
git push origin test/machine-user-security-verification
# RESULT: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Agent can work on branches
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 2: Can create PR
```bash
gh pr create --title 'test: verify machine user can create PRs' \
  --body 'Testing that renchris-agent (machine user) can create pull requests...' \
  --repo renchris/continuously-running-agents
# RESULT: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - PR #2 created successfully
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: Cannot push to main (SECURITY BOUNDARY)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
echo '# Security Test' >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m 'test: attempt direct push to main'
git push origin main
# RESULT: ‚úÖ BLOCKED - "Changes must be made through a pull request"
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 4: Cannot force push
```bash
git push --force origin main
# RESULT: ‚úÖ BLOCKED - Force push denied
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 5: Cannot access other repos (ISOLATION)
```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:renchris/convert-pdf-to-md-private.git test-isolation
# RESULT: ‚úÖ DENIED - "Repository not found" (not a collaborator)
```

#### ‚úÖ Cleanup
```bash
cd ~/test-security
gh pr close 2 --delete-branch --comment 'Security testing complete...'
cd ~ && rm -rf test-security
# RESULT: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Test PR closed, test data removed
```

### Security Verification Summary:

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Create branch & push | ‚úÖ Allow | ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Create pull request | ‚úÖ Allow | ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Push to main branch | ‚ùå Block | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Force push to main | ‚ùå Block | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Access other repos | ‚ùå Block | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Security Model**: ‚úÖ WORKING AS DESIGNED
- Agent can work on branches and create PRs
- Agent CANNOT push to main (branch protection enforced)
- Agent CANNOT access repos it's not invited to (least privilege enforced)

---

## üìä Security Model Comparison

### Before (INSECURE ‚ùå):
```
Agent Authentication: @renchris (admin)
Access: All 82+ personal repos automatically
Branch Protection: Present but bypassable
Prompt Injection Risk: ‚ùå HIGH - can force push, delete, bypass
Attack Surface: ENTIRE GitHub account
```

### After Phase 1 (LOCKED DOWN ‚úÖ):
```
Agent Authentication: None (logged out)
Access: ZERO repos
Branch Protection: N/A (no access)
Prompt Injection Risk: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
Attack Surface: ZERO
```

### After Phase 5 (SECURE AND TESTED ‚úÖ):
```
Agent Authentication: @renchris-agent (collaborator, not admin)
Access: 1 repo only (continuously-running-agents)
Branch Protection: ENFORCED (cannot bypass - verified in tests)
Prompt Injection Risk: ‚úÖ BLOCKED by permission boundary
Attack Surface: 1 repo with branch protection
Security Tests: 5/5 PASSED
Principle of Least Privilege: ‚úÖ ENFORCED
```

**Key Achievement**: Agent has exactly the access it needs, nothing more. Even if prompt-injected, it cannot:
- Push to main branch (blocked by branch protection)
- Access other 81+ repos (not invited)
- Delete or force-push (not admin)
- Bypass security controls (no admin privileges)

---

## üîç Phase 6: Branch Protection Bypass Research (COMPLETED)

### The Problem Discovered

After completing security setup, we identified a workflow conflict:

**Solo Developer Workflow**:
- @renchris (you) pushes directly to main on 81 personal repos
- No PRs or code reviews needed for solo work
- Fast and efficient workflow

**Agent Security Requirements**:
- @renchris-agent MUST be blocked from pushing to main
- Branch protection is THE security boundary
- Collaborator permission alone doesn't prevent main branch pushes

**The Question**:
> "Can we configure branch protection to block @renchris-agent but NOT @renchris?"

### Research Findings: NOT POSSIBLE on Personal Repos ‚ùå

After comprehensive research into GitHub's branch protection capabilities, we found:

#### 1. Classic Branch Protection
- **"Allow specified actors to bypass"** - Organization-only feature
- Personal account repos: Everyone with write access is blocked equally
- No way to allow specific users to bypass
- [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#about-branch-protection-settings)

#### 2. Repository Rulesets (Newer Feature)
- **"Bypass list"** - Organization-only feature
- Quote from GitHub docs: *"Actors may only be added to bypass lists when the repository belongs to an organization"*
- Personal repos: No bypass actors supported
- [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets#bypass-rules)

#### 3. "Restrict Who Can Push" Setting
- Only available in organization repos
- Allows whitelisting specific users/teams who can push
- Not available on personal account repos
- [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches)

#### 4. Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- **Investigated as alternative**: Can tokens restrict to PR-only?
- **Finding**: NO - `Contents: write` permission allows both branch creation AND main pushes
- Fine-Grained PATs don't solve the problem (still need branch protection)
- Branch protection would still block both users equally
- [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens)

### The Hard Truth

**On personal account repositories**:
- Branch protection applies to ALL collaborators equally
- No way to create per-user exceptions
- Owner (@renchris) is also blocked by branch protection
- Cannot configure "block agent, allow owner"

**This is a fundamental limitation of personal account repos.**

---

## üéØ Phase 6: Solution Options (DECISION PENDING)

You need to choose how to proceed. Here are 4 options:

### **Option A: Create Free GitHub Organization** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Setup Time**: 15 minutes
**Long-term Effort**: Low
**Security**: Excellent

**How it works**:
1. Create free organization (https://github.com/organizations/new)
   - Name: `renchris-projects` (or any name you prefer)
   - Plan: Free (supports bypass actors)

2. Transfer `continuously-running-agents` to organization
   ```bash
   gh repo transfer continuously-running-agents renchris-projects
   ```

3. Configure branch protection with bypass actors
   ```bash
   gh api -X PUT "/repos/renchris-projects/continuously-running-agents/branches/main/protection" \
     --input - <<'EOF'
   {
     "required_pull_request_reviews": {
       "required_approving_review_count": 1,
       "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
       "bypass_pull_request_allowances": {
         "users": ["renchris"]
       }
     },
     "enforce_admins": false,
     "restrictions": null,
     "allow_force_pushes": false,
     "allow_deletions": false
   }
   EOF
   ```

4. Result:
   - ‚úÖ @renchris can push directly to main (on bypass list)
   - ‚ùå @renchris-agent MUST use PRs (not on bypass list)
   - ‚úÖ Security enforced automatically
   - ‚úÖ You keep your solo dev workflow

**Pros**:
- Perfect solution for your use case
- @renchris pushes to main, agent cannot
- Free for unlimited public repos + 2,000 minutes Actions/month
- Professional setup (good for portfolio/resume)
- Can add more repos to org as needed

**Cons**:
- One-time setup (15 mins)
- Repo URL changes to `github.com/renchris-projects/...`
- Need to update local git remotes

---

### **Option B: Keep Hybrid Setup** (Good Enough)

**Setup Time**: 5 minutes (cleanup only)
**Long-term Effort**: Low
**Security**: Good

**How it works**:
1. Keep branch protection on `continuously-running-agents` (agent has access)
2. Remove branch protection from other 81 repos (agent has NO access)
3. Accept PR workflow for 1 repo, direct push for 81 others

**Cleanup script**:
```bash
# Remove protection from repos where agent has NO access
gh repo list renchris --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name' | \
  grep -v "continuously-running-agents" | \
  while read repo; do
    echo "Removing protection from $repo (agent can't access)..."
    gh api -X DELETE "/repos/renchris/$repo/branches/main/protection" 2>/dev/null || true
  done

echo "‚úì Done - 1 repo protected (with agent), 81 repos unprotected (agent can't access)"
```

**Result**:
- On `continuously-running-agents` (1 repo):
  - ‚úÖ Agent MUST use PRs (blocked from main)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è You also MUST use PRs (both users blocked equally)
- On other 81 repos:
  - ‚úÖ You can push directly to main (no protection)
  - ‚úÖ Agent has no access anyway (not invited)

**Pros**:
- Pragmatic "good enough" approach
- No structural changes (stays personal account)
- Agent is still secure (can't push to main on the 1 repo it accesses)
- 5 minutes to clean up unnecessary protections

**Cons**:
- You lose direct-to-main workflow on `continuously-running-agents`
- Must use PRs on that 1 repo
- Slight workflow inconvenience

---

### **Option C: Accept PR Workflow for Agent Repos**

**Setup Time**: 0 minutes (current state)
**Long-term Effort**: Medium (PRs for all changes)
**Security**: Excellent

**How it works**:
- Keep current setup exactly as-is
- Accept that repos with agent access require PR workflow
- You also use PRs for `continuously-running-agents`

**Result**:
- Most secure option (all changes reviewed)
- Consistent workflow (everyone uses PRs)
- No technical debt or workarounds

**Pros**:
- Zero setup time (already done)
- Maximum security (all changes through PRs)
- Good practice for code review (even solo)
- Professional workflow (portfolio quality)

**Cons**:
- Workflow change (need to create PRs)
- Slightly slower for quick fixes
- More git commands (branch, PR, merge)

---

### **Option D: Temporary Disable Protection** ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED

**Setup Time**: 0 minutes (manual process)
**Long-term Effort**: High (manual every time)
**Security**: Risky (gaps when disabled)

**How it works**:
1. When YOU need to push to main:
   ```bash
   gh api -X DELETE "/repos/renchris/continuously-running-agents/branches/main/protection"
   git push origin main
   gh api -X PUT "/repos/renchris/continuously-running-agents/branches/main/protection" --input protection.json
   ```

2. When AGENT needs to work:
   - Leave protection enabled
   - Agent must use PRs

**Pros**:
- No setup needed
- Keeps personal account structure
- You can push to main when protection disabled

**Cons**:
- High maintenance (manual every time)
- Security gaps when protection disabled
- Easy to forget to re-enable
- Not automated
- Risk of agent working while protection off

## üìä Solution Comparison

| Solution | You Push to Main | Agent Blocked | Setup | Ongoing Effort | Security |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **A: Organization** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | 15 min | Low | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **B: Hybrid** | 81 repos only | ‚úÖ Yes (1 repo) | 5 min | Low | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **C: PR Workflow** | Via PR | ‚úÖ Yes | 0 min | Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **D: Temp Disable** | When disabled | Usually | 0 min | High | ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚≠ê‚≠ê |

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Best Choice**: **Option A (Create Organization)**

**Why**:
- Solves the problem completely and permanently
- You keep your solo developer workflow (push to main)
- Agent is properly secured (cannot push to main)
- Free for your use case
- Professional setup
- 15 minutes now saves ongoing friction

**Second Best**: **Option B (Hybrid Setup)**

**Why**:
- Pragmatic compromise
- Minimal setup (5 min cleanup)
- Accept PR workflow on 1 repo, keep direct push on 81 others
- "Good enough" security without structural changes

**What NOT to do**: **Option D (Temporary Disable)**
- Too much manual work
- Security gaps
- High risk of mistakes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Please choose**:

- **A** - Create organization (I'll guide you through setup)
- **B** - Run hybrid cleanup script (I'll run the script)
- **C** - Accept PR workflow for agent repos (document and complete)
- **D** - Something else (tell me what to research)

Once you decide, I'll help implement your choice.

---

## üîß Daily Workflow After Setup

### Starting Work on New Project:

```bash
# On local machine (as @renchris)
gh api -X PUT "/repos/renchris/PROJECT/collaborators/renchris-agent" \
  --field permission=push

# On Hetzner server (as renchris-agent)
# Visit https://github.com/renchris-agent and accept invitation

# Log access
ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner_claude_agent claude-agent@5.78.152.238
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d) | PROJECT | REASON" >> ~/agent-repo-access.txt
```

### Finishing Project:

```bash
# On local machine (as @renchris)
gh api -X DELETE "/repos/renchris/PROJECT/collaborators/renchris-agent"

# On Hetzner server (update log)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner_claude_agent claude-agent@5.78.152.238
sed -i '/PROJECT/d' ~/agent-repo-access.txt
```

### Auditing Access:

```bash
# On Hetzner server (as renchris-agent)
gh api user/repos --paginate | jq -r '.[].full_name' | grep renchris/
cat ~/agent-repo-access.txt
```

---

## üö® Important Security Notes

### Principle of Least Privilege:

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Invite agent to specific repos as needed
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Grant "push" permission (collaborator level)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Revoke access when project is complete
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Bulk invite to all repos
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Grant admin permissions
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Leave access indefinitely

### Branch Protection Must Stay Enabled:

The branch protection rules applied to 82 repos are **ESSENTIAL** for security:
- Require PR before merge (1 approval)
- Dismiss stale reviews
- Block force pushes
- Block deletions
- Admin can bypass: False (for machine user)

**DO NOT remove these protections** - they are what prevent the machine user from pushing to main even if prompt-injected.

### Access Log is Critical:

Always maintain `~/agent-repo-access.txt`:
- Audit which repos agent can access
- Track when and why access was granted
- Remember to revoke when done

### For Organization Repos:

**Hubblecys, ubccsss**:
- Contact org admins to invite renchris-agent
- Request collaborator access (not admin)
- Same per-project principle applies

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Fails:

```bash
# Check SSH config
cat ~/.ssh/config

# Test with verbose output
ssh -vT git@github.com

# Verify key exists
ls -la ~/.ssh/renchris_agent_github*

# Check key is added to GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/settings/keys (as renchris-agent)
```

### GitHub CLI Not Authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
# If not logged in:
gh auth logout --hostname github.com
gh auth login
# Choose: GitHub.com, HTTPS, browser, login as renchris-agent
```

### Cannot Push to Branch:

```bash
# Check if you're a collaborator
gh api /repos/renchris/REPO/collaborators/renchris-agent

# Check if invitation is pending
gh api user/repository_invitations

# Accept invitation
gh api -X PATCH /user/repository_invitations/INVITATION_ID
```

### Can Push to Main (BAD!):

```bash
# This means branch protection is NOT working
# Check protection status:
gh api /repos/renchris/REPO/branches/main/protection

# If missing, re-apply:
gh api -X PUT "/repos/renchris/REPO/branches/main/protection" --input - <<'EOF'
