**New Documentation**: Production Deployment Cost Analysis

Added comprehensive cost analysis based on real production data from Oct 20, 2025 monitoring:

- Actual resource usage metrics (CPU, RAM, system load)  
- Current per-agent costs on Hetzner infrastructure
- Immediate optimization path to reduce costs by 37%

This data-driven analysis replaces speculation with measurable production metrics
and provides actionable next steps for cost optimization.
