docs: comprehensive documentation improvements phase 2 (5 gaps addressed)

Addresses 5 high-priority and medium-priority gaps from DOCUMENTATION-GAPS.md analysis, adding 1,266 lines of production-ready documentation and tooling.

**New Files**:

1. **CONFIG-REFERENCE.md** (676 lines) - GAP-021
   - Complete configuration reference for all Claude Code options
   - Tables for: .claude/config.json, settings.json, environment variables, resource limits
   - Systemd configuration, tmux management, security considerations
   - Examples and troubleshooting for every section

2. **scripts/monitoring/cost-tracker.sh** (294 lines) - GAP-011
   - Daily API usage tracking from agent logs
   - Cost calculation based on token counts (input/output/cache)
   - 7-day summary with budget warnings
   - Cron automation support

**Enhanced Documentation**:

3. **05-cost-optimization.md** (+17 lines, -6 lines) - GAP-007
   - Updated API pricing table with October 2025 verified rates
   - Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, Haiku 4.5 current pricing
   - Tiered pricing documentation (>200K context)
   - Source link and verification date added

4. **08-llm-provider-setup.md** (+279 lines) - GAP-014, GAP-015
   - **GAP-014**: Complete 15-minute OVHCloud setup walkthrough
     - 6-step guide from account creation to first SSH connection
     - Expected outputs for every command
     - Validation steps, cost breakdown, region recommendations
   - **GAP-015**: Single-to-multi agent migration example
     - Real-world 1â†’5 agent scaling scenario
     - Before/after configs with bash scripts
     - Resource planning and anti-patterns

**Impact**:

- **GAP-007 (HIGH)**: Users can budget accurately with current pricing
- **GAP-014 (HIGH)**: First-time users can provision OVHCloud in 15 minutes
- **GAP-011 (MEDIUM)**: Users can track and optimize API costs automatically
- **GAP-015 (MEDIUM)**: Users have concrete migration path for scaling
- **GAP-021 (MEDIUM)**: All configuration options centrally documented

**Agent Performance**:
- 3/5 tasks completed autonomously by Claude Code agents
- 2/5 completed manually (agent startup failures)
- Total runtime: ~3 minutes average per autonomous task

**Remaining Gaps**: 19 gaps remain (see DOCUMENTATION-GAPS.md for roadmap)
