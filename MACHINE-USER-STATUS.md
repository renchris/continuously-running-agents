# Machine User Setup - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready

---

## TL;DR

**What we have**: Secure machine user (@renchris-agent) with least privilege access. Owner can push to main, agent cannot.

**Solution**: `enforce_admins: false` allows owner to bypass branch protection while blocking collaborators.

---

## ✅ Final Configuration

### Security Model ✅
```
@renchris (owner):
  ✅ Push directly to main (admin bypass enabled)
  ✅ Full repository access (settings, deletion, etc.)

@renchris-agent (collaborator):
  ✅ Push to feature branches
  ✅ Create pull requests
  ❌ BLOCKED from pushing to main
  ❌ BLOCKED from repository settings/deletion
  ❌ BLOCKED from accessing other 81 repos
```

### Branch Protection Settings ✅
```json
{
  "enforce_admins": false,           // ← Allows owner bypass
  "required_pr_reviews": 1,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
```

### Security Testing ✅
All tests PASSED:
- ✅ Owner CAN push to main (verified)
- ✅ Agent BLOCKED from pushing to main (verified)
- ✅ Agent CAN push to feature branches (verified)
- ✅ Agent DENIED access to other repos (verified)

---

## 🔑 Key Insight

**The `enforce_admins: false` setting is the key:**
- Repository **owner** (admin) = **Can bypass** branch protection
- **Collaborators** (agent) = **Cannot bypass**, must follow protection rules

No organization needed! Personal account works perfectly.

---

## 📋 Current Access

**@renchris-agent has access to**:
- ✅ `continuously-running-agents` (1 repo)

**@renchris-agent does NOT have access to**:
- ❌ 81+ other personal repos
- ❌ Organization repos

**Security**: ✅ Least privilege enforced

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Check Agent Status (on Hetzner)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner_claude_agent claude-agent@5.78.152.238 "gh auth status && cat ~/agent-repo-access.txt"
```

### Grant Access to New Repo (from local machine)
```bash
gh api -X PUT "/repos/renchris/REPO_NAME/collaborators/renchris-agent" --field permission=push
```

### Revoke Access (from local machine)
```bash
gh api -X DELETE "/repos/renchris/REPO_NAME/collaborators/renchris-agent"
```

**Bottom Line**: Setup complete, security working, just need to choose workflow model.
